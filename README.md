# üöÄ Project: Proxmox Homelab + Terraform

Welcome to this project where we will build a **complete homelab** based on [Proxmox VE](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve), managed through Terraform, deploying multimedia, monitoring, and virtualization services.

## üñ•Ô∏è Server Hardware

![Physical Server](docs/SOSSR_Logo.webp)

**Server specifications:**

- **CPU**: Quad-Core (4 physical cores)  
- **RAM**: 16 GB DDR4  
- **Storage:**
  - **5 SSDs** of 900 GB (RAID Z1 - ZFS)  
  - **2 NVMe** of 4 TB (for high-performance VMs)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Objectives

1. Install and configure **Proxmox VE** on the physical server.  
2. Use **Terraform** to automate the creation of multiple virtual machines.  
3. Deploy essential services for entertainment, development, and monitoring.  
4. Manage a **Harvester cluster** consisting of **3 nodes**, each with **12 cores**, **16 GB RAM**, and **512 GB storage** for **Longhorn**.  
5. Orchestrate all infrastructure with Terraform and **CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and a self hosted Runner**.

## üß± Automated Infrastructure with Terraform

Terraform will:

- Provision VMs in Proxmox and the Harvester cluster.  
- Apply basic configuration (cloud-init with SSH keys).
